********************NATURE poems********************
Nature is fair and beautiful
Nature is fair and beautiful
And what you want from me, I'll gladly give
I'll love to live near you.


Oh, nature is sweet and lovely
Nature is sweet and beautiful
And what you want from me, I'll gladly give
I'll love to live near you.


Oh, nature is fair and beautiful
Nature is sweet and beautiful
And what you want from me, I'll gladly give
I'll love to live near you.



********************LOVE poems********************
Love's a thing that seems,
It must be so.
Love's a thing that seems
That's hard to bare
It's hard to give it.

Love is a thing,
It can hurt,
It can make you frown,
It can make you love,
Love's a thing that's hard to bare.

Love's a thing,
It turns your face away,
It makes the world go round,
Love's a thing that seems,
And hard to bare.


********************RELIGION poems********************
Religion and morality are not the same.
You cannot have an honest conversation.
God is not interested in you.
God is not interested in what you want,
or what you are.
You can have a happy or unhappy life
without religion, morality and religion.

You can have a rich or poor life
without religion, morality and religion.
God is not interested in you.
Your life is your own affair.
You have nothing to fear or worry.
God is not concerned with you.
And even your present life will be incomplete.

Religion and morality don't tie together.
You can have a happy or unhappy life
without religion, morality and religion.
