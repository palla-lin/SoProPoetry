Life is full of challenges like finding food in the morning, searching for a sweet cup of coffee, seeking love and finding a mate that has respect for one that one is single, being a bit careless while searching for a mate. Life is full of different kinds of situations, like we are here to learn something new everyday. Some say life is full of sorrow and stress, but that’s just not true and will never be the same.Life is full of ups, downs and sometimes life’s great ups. Life is full of challenges like winning a pot of gold every day and trying to eat at least once every day. Life is full of joys like being a parent and loving your children. Life is full of great moments and some will find they will make it out alive someday. Life is full of great decisions that have to be made everyday. It is not always about winning the race but it is about trying to make it through life, overcoming obstacles, holding on to hope and making someones dreams. Life is full of great people and great times. Life is full of great opportunities and some are few but it never will be the same.\n",
