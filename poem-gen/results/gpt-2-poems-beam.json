It is important to note that depression is not just a bad thing, it can be a great blessing and a terrible curse."}, "6": {"Keywords": "rest,types,cave,appetite,thinking", "Perplexity": 5.705997467041016, "Poem": "Depression is a feeling of being alone,\nA feeling that you have no place to go.\nIt can be overwhelming and overwhelming\nLike a mountain of snow falling on your head\nYour mind and body are in a state of disarray\nYou don\u2019t know how to deal with it\nAnd your mind is at a loss\nWhat can you do?\n"}, "7": {"Keywords": "hacker,terror,painkillers,mptiness,feeling", "Perplexity": 5.6811723709106445, "Poem": "Depression is a state of mind\nIt can be so overwhelming\nYou feel like you\u2019re in a dark place\nBut you don't know what to do\n\nWhen you feel down and out of your depth\nThere are no friends to talk to\nNo one to care if you cry or smile\nAnd there is no way to make up for the pain that has been taken away\n"}, "8": {"Keywords": "rift,eath,razor,self hatred,romance", "Perplexity": 4.99786376953125, "Poem": "Depression is the feeling of being alone,\nthe feeling that you have no place to go, and\nthat you will never be able to be with other people again.\nIt leaves you feeling like you are in a ragged hole, with no one to lean on and no way to get out of the rickety rucksack you used to have.

Depression is a feeling of being alone, with nothing to look forward to, no friends to talk to and no direction to follow. It leaves a void in your life that is filled with empty hopes and empty dreams, that's why it haunts you every day. If you feel it then you are in deep depression, it is because of something you did or did not do, a lack of motivation to move forward and a need to control your temper. There is nothing that can be done to ease the pain, but you must learn to deal with it and try to do the right thing in order to make it go away. When you get to the point of no return, there is no turning back, you just have to take a step back and let go of the things that made you sad and depressed. Then you will be back where you started, in the same place you used to be, without the sadness and the depression. You will find that there are no more problems that will make you happy and that no matter what you do to yourself and others, depression will never leave you. So take the time to sit down and write down your thoughts, thoughts and feelings, because depression is what makes you lose your mind and your heart and soul and make the world a better place. \n"}}, "hope": {"0": {"Keywords": "pleasant thoughts,despair,loneliness,friends,authority", "Perplexity": 10.367500305175781, "Poem": "HOPE IS THE HOPE OF MAN\n\nHope is the strength of a man\nWhen he is able to overcome his obstacles\nAnd live a life of contentment.\n"}, "1": {"Keywords": "fulminations,vain,thy heart,snow,cloud", "Perplexity": 11.173091888427734, "Poem": "HOPE IS THE WIND\n\nHope is the wind that blows\nHoping for the day to come\nWhen snow will fall from the sky\nAnd the sun will rise again.\n"}, "2": {"Keywords": "siren,miracles,friends,bet,humans", "Perplexity": 12.861189842224121, "Poem": "Hope is like a mirage\nIt's the only thing that can keep us all alive\nHope can be a blessing or a curse\nIf you don't believe in hope\nThen you'll never be able to be yourself again.\n"}, "3": {"Keywords": "frail sweat,nurses,sorrow,spring,hopeless persons", "Perplexity": 9.52422046661377, "Poem": "HOPE IS THE WONDERFUL SNAKES OF THE EARLY YEARS\n\nHope is the balm of the weary soul\nHopes for the future are feeble and dim\nAnd hope is nothing but a mirage.\n"}, "4": {"Keywords": "thy light,sunshine,magician,convent,dear illusions", "Perplexity": 8.911909103393555, "Poem": "HOPE IS THE ONLY PRESENT\n\nHope is the only present\nThat I have in all my life\nTo show the world that I am real\nAnd that my spirit is real.\n"}, "5": {"Keywords": "enlightened prayers,loneliness,heart,life hope,kites", "Perplexity": 14.191818237304688, "Poem": "Life is a journey, and you must make it through.\nYou must overcome your obstacles,\nand overcome the enmity of life.\n\n\n\u00a9 Joe Fazio\n"}, "6": {"Keywords": "poison,california,spring,peace,hope floats", "Perplexity": 334.0753479003906, "Poem": "HOPE IS THE HOPE OF LIFE\n"}, "7": {"Keywords": "kites,dreams,ghosts,eternity,occult", "Perplexity": 9.222880363464355, "Poem": "I dreamt of a time when I was young,\nAnd you were near.\nI dreamed of you, and I saw your face\nIn my dreams;\nBut the ghost of my youth\nWould not come again\nUntil I reached the age of\nTwenty-four.\n\n\nTranslated by Robert Hass\n"}, "8": {"Keywords": "charms,turn,heart,scratch,recovery", "Perplexity": 22.142385482788086, "Poem": "HOPE IS A CHANCE\n\nHope is a chance\nto turn the other cheek\nand make it real\n"}, "9": {"Keywords": "tears,experience love,waits,gale,love", "Perplexity": 4.493868827819824, "Poem": "Hope is the key to happiness.\nHope makes you feel like you're in heaven,\nWaiting for the right person to take you on a ride.

There are rumours that the Mayor of London might want to attend the game and that there will be a huge crowd of supporters from Rio to cheer on the winning side. However, there are no plans for a football match between Rio and Belo Horizonte, a country most famous for its footballing culture and tradition. It is unlikely that any of these clubs would be willing to sell their young players to foreign clubs in order to maintain their brand and image.

I also told them that I was growing up in a world where drugs were legal and that my parents were very proud of me, even though I had a history of heart attacks and strokes. My parents also said that they would never let me go because of my past and how bad things were for me. So, I went to the local drug store and bought four packs of pills, which were labeled as Vicodin and clomiphene, both of which are illegal under the Misuse of Substances Act of 1973. When I got them, they said I would die within a matter of an hour of taking the pills because they had no way of knowing if it would work or would break my heart if I took them too soon. The next day, my mom called me and said, \u201cHey! \u201d I replied with a look of disbelief and disbelief. She then asked if my dad would be okay with me getting out of this life because he had cancer and had to end it right now because it was his turn to die. It was then I realized that this was going to be my last goodbyes, because I could no longer live without my pills. That night I woke up one morning feeling so alive and breathing so good, but my body was still hurting and I felt so empty inside and out. All my friends and family came running and jumping up and down, trying to save me from myself and my family and friends. They were all very upset and crying at the thought of losing my life and being in the hospital with no one to talk to, so I decided to just go out and get some help and not have to worry about anything anymore. At the end of the last ride I passed out on the side of State Road 61, where the highway was narrow and the road was very bumpy with people passing and people jumping and bumping into each other. There were people who tried to help me but they were too scared to try and help because there were so many people in front of them waiting in line and waiting so long to get out before they got to pick me up or even wait until the truck was loaded with all the other medical supplies I needed to survive."}, "4": {"Keywords": "arboretum,age,rhymes,fortune,magic", "Perplexity": 9.459386825561523,

Respect for one's family is another important factor in making a happy and fulfilling life for yourself, your family and your loved ones. There is no better place for respect than in Heaven, where there is a God and His Son, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Lord of the living God above, who has given us the ability to live our life in a way that is right for us, our family, and our God. The more one feels the respect the more he/she will feel and will appreciate the special things that the Lord has in store for his/her family. If one is in doubt, ask your Heavenly Father for a friend who is willing to listen and to help you through the tough times, especially those times when you are in need. You will find that you can count on one hand the number of angels who are listening and caring for you and for your every need, no matter how hard you may struggle, God will always be there to take care of you.
