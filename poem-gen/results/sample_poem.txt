********************SLEEP poems********************
1: Thou art asleep,
Not knowing of me
While I sleep;
But lo, where thou art
I dream of thee,
The only one that sees
The light that thou art--

The one that sees
The soul, who, awake,
Hath looked through thy veil
The long night-hours
Of all night.

Come, thou child of night,
Out of the dark cave--
See how I slept
Like the others.
I sleep in thy hand--
But my ghost hears--
So I pray I am dead.



----------------------------------------
2: O I awake, and with a sigh
Within my tired soul's sleep I lie:--
I must a while sleep, and then be awakened again.
Sleep! let me not think
Of your soft and loving arms I wear;
Of the soft arms that embrace me:--
But when, with my dying breath, I wake,
I cannot think I shall have known you.

My fingers, in vain they pursue
The thin and sweet-smelling string of sleep:--
I cannot lift my face from their kiss.
My heart is worn, and I cannot know
The place of your arms I must take.
Sleep! sleep! wherefore, if in thy hour I die,
Will you, or angels, come to me?

When night is breaking on thy lea,
And the light is withdrawn--
When morning's sighs the light turns to silver,
When night's lute has ceased,
I'll be awakened on the other side,
I'm in my bed!



----------------------------------------
3: Somehow the angel was
In the bed of my bed;
Somehow he woke me
At the first sign of waking,
And said: 'This morning will be dark.
There are some things which you must see,
The windows are rickety;
They cannot even open the doors;
No one wants to come and sit in that.'
So I was turned away:
Then he led me out
And said: 'Come, and eat my supper.
You must have something to eat,
Something you can smell,
Something you can smell.
Just eat, my dear,
The flesh is so golden,
I'm eating it in the middle of the night.'
Thus I went to sleep,
And woke up at a sound
Like that of a bird that flies.

********************NATURE poems********************
1: Nature is  a sweet flower,
The softest of the blue,
That ever one man hath got.
And thou, my sweet tree,
Wre sent out to all to show
That it hath got thee.

My little bird, my little tree,
That never in the world
Can grow any flower,
Nature send thee out to all.



----------------------------------------
2: We all know the trees around us,
The greenhouses that shade the ground,
The tall silvery mansions we'd adore,
The old mansions with their private gardens,
We'd watch the trees around us as they fade,
And marvel what beauty there is in Nature!

Oh I wonder, can we look on Nature as if we were Gods,
When such beauty could be placed in man's pride,
And there would be no place for him in Nature,
For Nature is a tree, and man an insect,
And birds have different names from man.



----------------------------------------
3: When the spring leaves come down,
The birds are singing.
When the trees close to the ground,
The birds are leaving trees to fly.
When the sun rise in the evening,
The birds are singing.
When spring comes in the summer,
The birds are coming in.
When the leaves come down,
The birds are singing.
When the sun rise in the afternoon,
The birds are singing.
When the tree close to the ground,
The birds are leaving trees to fly.

********************SKY poems********************
1: Hopes of wings
Are just like hope
That you
Will soar
Into a sky
So calm and blue

That we
Will walk
Through the storm
Of love
And never fear
The darkness
Of our own fears
That sometimes
We get
Harmonized
Till we are gone



----------------------------------------
2: Hear me, then, my friend, or my enemy
In the darkest hour and darkest day.
For the love I give to you is true.
I give it to you for God
I give it, for that is my reward.
For the love I give to you is true.

And if I give to you something
You want, just give to me,
And I will give you what I want.
There is no hiding, your waiting here.
If I give you something
You want, just give to me,
And I will give you what you ask.

Because I know that you know
You are mine, I am not yours,
And I will do everything I can
For God's little child is here.
Because I know that she will love me
And I will be their angel forever.



----------------------------------------
3: There is a secret love hidden deep within
The wings of the angel in me that is waiting
And waiting for my love
The wings of a butterfly so big and bold
The wings of a bird so beautiful and pure
Waiting for my love
Waiting for a night to come and end

What do you all mean to me
Do you all mean to me
When we last spoke we did not mean to stay
For we did not want to leave this place
So we came to this land for a honeymoon
And we came to this land to save
A life from a person who is not our own
Waiting so long to be a part of his or her life

********************CHILDHOOD poems********************
1: Let's give our childhood a colorful color
Let's give our childhood a little candy
Let's give our childhood a little crack.

Let's give our childhood a little colorful,
Let's give our childhood a little candy.
We can show our childhood to ours,
We can show their little crack.

2: I always felt that I had all the answers to everything
I wanted to make it to the top of the charts
I wanted to have my family name recognized
I wanted to be loved and adored
I wanted to have my favorite foods and drink
I wanted to have fun and be proud
I wanted to have my favorite places to visit
I wanted to do all the things I could
I wanted to do everything that I could

And when I was done all the things I had planned
And all the things that were going to come to pass
That day I cried and cried too

I cried a lot
And cried a lot more
I was scared and scared
I was crying a lot more
And I cried a lot more

Now that I've become this auntie
And no longer will I be this special kid
I still wonder when will this be my last time
As I know that this day will be a blur
For everything that I've done
will be different then when
I was a kid.



----------------------------------------
3: Childhood is a funny thing.
You don't know the whole story until you grow up.
But some times, there seems to be a little truth.
Some kids cry and some never cry.
You shouldn't have to hide your feelings for them.
It's funny when all that is important to you
Is something that is always out of sight.
