forget not divine justice! what discrepancies be corrected by what measures we don't know, but divine justice sure will
 do rectify them one day or other! man made justice may be duped by loop holes of law, but divine justice will surely take 
 revenge to bring order to world one day! till then the boat will only go with the stream current and who can render justice 
 to all the crimes that are piling up on? we can only just wait and watch ever what's going on before our own eyes here to 
 learn lessons from experience!

i am happy, you are happy, we are happy to be both here; it's so lovely, yes so lovely, it's summertime in the air . when a 
bloom's born in spring, see how lovely it becomes, with your heart along sing, wake up from winter ’ s glums; life is growing 
again, from the old that's asleep, from the mountains to glen, all the flowers now reap . you will be singing in tune, with 
the wonders of time, for the blossoms of june, fit like a song to a rime; when all life comes in full, with its growth and its 
skills, no moment's longer dull, there's just song in the hills . i am happy, you are happy, it's the happiest time of the year; 
it's so lovely, yes so lovely, when life's growing everywhere . time renews all our wishes, what grows old is born anew, after 
some temporary glitches, again earth restores its debut.

====================Poem=5====================
the longest tyranny that ever sway'd was that wherein our ancestors betray'd their free-born reason to the stagirite, and made
his torch their universal light . so truth, while only one supplied the state, grew scarce, and dear, and yet sophisticate; until'twas 
bought, like emp'ric wares, or charms, hard words seal'd up with aristotle's arms . columbus was the first that shook his throne, and 
found a temp'rate in a torrid zone: the fev'rish air fann'd by a cooling breeze, the fruitful vales set round with shady trees; and 
guiltless men, who danc'd away their time, fresh as their groves, and happy as their clime . had we still paid that homage to a name, 
which only god and nature justly claim, the western seas had been our utmost bound, where poets still might dream the sun was drown'd: 
and all the stars that shine in southern skies had been admir'd by none but savage eyes . among th' asserters of free reason's claim, th' 
english are not the least in worth, or fame . the world to bacon does not only owe its present knowledge, but its future too . gilbert shall
 live, till loadstones cease to draw, or british fleets the boundless ocean awe . and noble boyle, not less in nature seen, than his great brother 
 read in states and men . the circling streams, once thought but pools, of blood (whether life's fuel or the body's food), from dark oblivion harvey's 
 name shall save; while ent keeps all the honour that he gave . ...

====================Poem=1====================
there comes a time in everybody's life when one keeps floating and flowing in a dreamy and dramatic way, feeling free and 
uninhibited, smiling with the flowers, talking to and smiling in the adda of his own, a hero in the making stylistic and 
fashionable, becoming the matter of the talk of the side heroines and the heroine . but there also a comes a time in the 
life of the hero when he starts falling, the flowers come not into the sweet dreams, under the stars and the moon and their 
mysterious twinkles and moonshine, babbles he not, smiles he not, prefers to be alone, returning dejected and forlorn from 
the love city of the beloved, slapped by the hardcore realities of this real life . o young man playing the role of a musician, 
a singer or an announcer, life is not the stage of a theatre, life is not what you envisage into the sweet dreams of yours, life 
not so imaginative and fanciful, look back on those who struggle, sacrifice and suffer and for whom look you a hero, but that too 
is coming to a close with the theatre closing down! frustrated and forlorn, the romantic returning into the steps of his, fatigued 
and depressed after being beaten on the life front and failed, loved and lost, flirted and deceived he and now life deceiving and 
betraying him for what he did, what he took it for romanticism as to love and abandon is not at all romanticism and to dress stylistically 
too is not as a loafer too dresses in the likewise manner.

i have loved colours, and not flowers; their motion, not the swallows wings; and wasted more than half my hours without the comradeship of 
things . how is it, now, that i can see, with love and wonder and delight, the children of the hedge and tree, the little lords of day and 
night? how is it that i see the roads, no longer with usurping eyes, a twilight meeting-place for toads, a mid-day mart for butterflies? i 
feel, in every midge that hums, life, fugitive and infinite, and suddenly the world becomes a part of me and i of it.

in love! but…………………… .. not with love that dazzles and disappears, not with love that rejects and recedes, not with love that deliberates and 
deceives, not with love that demands and dominates! i am not in love with any of these, i am in love with ‘ love' itself! love that is unquestionable, 
love that is unpretentious, love that is unpremeditated, love that is unparalleled! yes! in love with love- love that is pure bliss!

birds sing "i love you, love" the whole day through, and not another song can they sing right; but, singing done with, loving's done with quite, the 
autumn sunders every twittering two . and i'd not have love make too much ado with sweet parades of fondness and delight, lest iterant wont should make 
caresses trite, love-names mere cuckoo ousters of the true . oh heart can hear heart's sense in senseless nought, and heart that's sure of heart has little 
speech . what shall it tell? the other knows its thought . what shall one doubt or question or beseech who is assured and knows and, unbesought, possesses 
the dear trust that each gives each.
