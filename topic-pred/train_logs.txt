====================Poem=1====================
oh! form'd by nature, and refin'd by art, with charms to win, and sense to fix the heart! by thousands sought, clotilda, canst thou free thy croud of captives and descend to me? content in shades obscure to waste thy life, a hidden beauty and a country wife . o! listen while thy summers are my theme, ah! sooth thy partner in his waking dream! in some small hamlet on the lonely plain, where thames, through meadows, rolls his mazy train; or where high windsor, thick with greens array'd, waves his old oaks, and spreads his ample shade, fancy has figur'd out our calm retreat; already round the visionary seat our limes begin to shoot, our flowers to spring, the brooks to murmur, and the birds to sing . where dost thou lie, thou thinly-peopled green? thou nameless lawn, and village yet unseen? where sons, contented with their native ground, ne'er travell'd further than ten furlongs round; and the tann'd peasant, and his ruddy bride, were born together, and together died . where early larks best tell the morning light, and only philomel disturbs the night, 'midst gardens here my humble pile shall rise, with sweets surrounded of ten thousand dies; all savage where th' embroider'd gardens end, the haunt of echoes, shall my woods ascend; and oh! if heaven th' ambitious thought approve, a rill shall warble cross the gloomy grove, a little rill, o'er pebbly beds convey'd, gush down the steep, and glitter through the glade . what chearing scents those bordering banks exhale! how loud that heifer lows from yonder vale! that thrush how shrill! his note so clear, so high, he drowns each feather'd minstrel of the sky . here let me trace beneath the purpled morn, the deep-mouth'd beagle, and the sprightly horn; or lure the trout with well dissembled flies, or fetch the fluttering partridge from the skies . nor shall thy hand disdain to crop the vine, the downy peach, or flavour'd nectarine; or rob the bee-hive of its golden hoard, and bear th' unbought luxuriance to thy board . sometimes my books by day shall kill the hours, while from thy needle rise the silken flowers, and thou, by turns, to ease my feeble sight, resume the volume, and deceive the night . oh! when i mark thy twinkling eyes opprest, soft whispering, let me warn my love to rest; then watch thee, charm'd, while sleep locks every sense, and to sweet heaven commend thy innocence . thus reign'd our fathers o'er the rural fold, wise, hale, and honest in the days of old; till courts arose, where substance pays for show, and specious joys are bought with real woe . see flavia's pendants, large, well-spread, and right, the ear that wears them hears a fool each night: mark how the embroider'd colonel sneaks away, to shun the withering dame that made him gay; that knave, to gain a title, lost his fame; that rais'd his credit by a daughter's shame; this coxcomb's ribband cost him half his land, and oaks, unnumber'd, bought that fool a wand . fond man, as all his sorrows were too few, acquires strange wants that nature never knew, by midnight lamps he emulates the day, and sleeps, perverse, the chearful suns away; from goblets high-embost, his wine must glide, found his clos'd sight the gorgeous curtain slide; fruits ere their time to grace his pomp must rise, and three untasted courses glut his eyes . for this are nature's gentle calls withstood, the voice of conscience, and the bonds of blood; this wisdom thy reward for every pain, and this gay glory all thy mighty gain . fair phantoms woo'd and scorn'd from age to age, since bards began to laugh, and priests to rage . and yet, just curse on man's aspiring kind, prone to ambition, to example blind, our children's children shall our steps pursue, and the same errours be for ever new . mean while in hope a guiltless country swain, my reed with warblings chears the imagin'd plain . hail humble shades, where truth and silence dwell! the noisy town and faithless court farewell! farewell ambition, once my darling flame! the thirst of lucre, and the charm of fame! in life's by-road, that winds through paths unknown, my days, though number'd, shall be all my own . here shall they end, (o! might they twice begin) and all be white the fates intend to spin.

the truth is dark under your eyelids . what are you going to do about it? the birds are silent; there's no one to ask . all day long you'll squint at the gray sky . when the wind blows you'll shiver like straw . a meek little lamb you grew your wool till they came after you with huge shears . flies hovered over open mouth, then they, too, flew off like the leaves, the bare branches reached after them in vain . winter coming . like the last heroic soldier of a defeated army, you'll stay at your post, head bared to the first snow flake . till a neighbor comes to yell at you, you're crazier than the weather, charlie.

heart, believe me . that was just a night...how fool it is for my mind to linger his words this way; to trace every curve of his lips and to flip a shadow of his pretty hair . oh, how fool it is for my mind to think of him this way . heart, believe me . that was just a night; and i became a fool forever.

this day i perfect the whole hour of reasoning, inside this whole month my sentences are concise . philosophy is sweet, just and not ruinous, with polite speech you talk over matters real . scholars are of the opinion, understanding is the key to manhood ’ s success, may the months survive and the weeks endure, may the philosopher too holy prevail to enlighten me further, justice is the key to overall success.

====================Poem=5====================
there were thick leaves above me and around, and low sweet sighs like those of childhood's sleep, amidst their dimness, and a fitful sound as of soft showers on water; dark and deep lay the oak shadows o'er the turf, so still they seem'd but pictured glooms: a hidden rill made music, such as haunts us in a dream, under the fern-tufts; and a tender gleam of soft green light, as by the glow-worm shed, came pouring thro' the woven beech-boughs down, and steep'd the magic page wherein i read of royal chivalry and old renown, a tale of palestine . meanwhile the bee swept past me with a tone of summer hours, a drowsy bugle, wafting thoughts of flowers, blue skies, and amber sunshine: brightly free, on filmy wings the purple dragon-fly shot glancing like a fairy javelin by; and a sweet voice of sorrow told the dell where sat the lone wood-pigeon: but ere long, all sense of these things faded, as the spell breathing from that high gorgeous tale grew strong on my chain'd soul:'twas not the leaves i heard a syrian wind the lion-banner stirr'd, thro' its proud, floating folds:'twas not the brook, singing in secret thro' its grassy glen; a wild shrill trumpet of the saracen peal'd from the desert's lonely heart, and shook the burning air . like clouds when winds are high, o'er glittering sands flew steeds of araby, and tents rose up, and sudden lance and spear flash'd where a fountain's diamond wave lay clear, shadow'd by graceful palm-trees . then the shout of merry england's joy swell'd freely out, sent thro' an eastern heaven, whose glorious hue made shields dark mirrors to its depths of blue: and harps were there; i heard their sounding strings, as the waste echoed to the mirth of kings . the bright masque faded . unto life's worn track, what call'd me from its flood of glory, back? a voice of happy childhood! and they pass'd, banner, and harp, and paynim's trumpet's blast; yet might i scarce bewail the splendours gone, my heart so leap'd to that sweet laughter's tone.
