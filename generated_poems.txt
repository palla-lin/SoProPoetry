# love
i'd  force  love  more  freezing 
a  river  once  upon  my 
in  blest  bearing  pauses  passion for another

id  return  a  pen  leaves 
witness  and  you  find  your 
but  beating  funny  but  never ever ask


my  love  is  a  song 
my  bits  today  lightning  so 
did climbing all choose contemplation 


# nature
you  will  see  the  wind 
colors  still  as  ten  dollars 
can  deal  with  nothing  or happiness is fun for them 

#sun
strength  that  cannot  hold  dearest 
her  dwelling  friend  her  beauty 
rue  yeah  as  carry  me alive 


# angel
boat  the  queen  of  life 
some  relief  yet  sweet  an 
adults  play  should  dreaming  
bright soil more and more its child 


empty  was  soft  and  future 
deep  trouble  the  fairest  light 
broken  things  now  have  pale 


# anger
searing  spark  up  fast  asleep 
with  hopes  lamp  angered  keep 
by  thy  numbers  can  fly these years
will not turn loss 


# trust
strength  entering  envelopes  fill  beneath 
christian  kids  beloved  lips  breathing 
water  with  mine  making  hand 
pride  but  not  any  human kind
