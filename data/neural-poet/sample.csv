sleep,the moon seems very loud tonight I need a cloud to put out the light 
today,I saw a reason to smile today when I saw a butterfly flutter its wings around my way  I saw a reason to smile today when I heard the children laughing and playing under the warm sun of May  I saw a reason to smile today when I looked up and saw no clouds of gray  But most of all I saw a reason to smile today when I saw you pass by which completed my day 
justice,i have my personal justice written across my pulse constant thoughts and very clear needs my personal justice is just that personal like a thief whose money youre carrying thats me if only luck didnt have so much to do with it or time or life who says im not better life has its own will and it does not care about your plans or secrets or hopes you bury inside counting minutes days months for your justice to have its turn it does not have a turn time couldnt care less you can be your own prisonner if you like life wont even bother  still when will you surrender 
sleep,Time to rest our eyes We visit imagination Best vacation of mind Hidden desires lost memories Hopeful prayers arent blind Stand up and speak clear When in real timewe sleep Viewing is on the clock More thoughts to keep Time to rest in hours Dreaming in peace Sleeping in peace Fear isnt common Occuring once a blue Control your eyes Wake up for two This is a test Prepare for life Dream to make Sleep to dream

nature,Calm is all nature as a resting wheel The kine are couched upon the dewy grass The horse alone seen dimly as I pass Is cropping audibly his later meal Dark is the ground a slumber seems to steal Oer vale and mountain and the starless sky Now in this blank of things a harmony Homefelt and homecreated comes to heal That grief for which the senses still supply Fresh food for only then when memory Is hushed am I at rest My Friends restrain Those busy cares that would allay my pain Oh leave me to myself nor let me feel The officious touch that makes me droop again 
depression,No outward sign for you to see I try acting as normal as one can be Desperation is my call Suddenly Ive had enough of it all The tears the moods the ups and downs What is happening with me Leave me alone I say let me be Everything gets to me this misery I must divert my thought on the good things when negativity pulls me down I must think positive and redesign my life Yes this is what I must do Burying my head under covers is not the way for me or you I am aware this wont be easy It all takes some time But before you know it things will work out just fine 
hope,Hope is an expectation or Desire for certain event It relates to persons things Or to circumstances it is inherent  Not only men but also animal And birds reptiles have hope All live on hope or hope against hope Hopeless persons have no scope  Men live in hope and In hope they dream To dream many lovely things Is too dream of a team  Hope is the reason of attachment And it is the art It is too reason of detachment And it is the heart  Maximum people hope to get Perishable things they want But these are such things Those bring men daunt  Hope to lead valuable life And value in life is the best We must hope peace and bless of God There actually are the zests 
thanks,All around the world poems are talking among themselves when the books are shut when the computers are switched off when oldfashioned poets put down chewed pencils sucked ballpens lips a little stained with the flavour of ink that’s washable or permanent  poems talking among themselves in that language that poems understand that poets seek to write poems murmuring complaining sometimes shouting desperately  who are these people who have dared to speak our language What is their right and reason When did they arise Where did they get their ideas Why do they even try How do they hope to improve on this What is a poet anyway  The tumult of their languages the babel of upraised voices speaking though  with that unutterable beauty of that sound which can really act can change the world of change can touch the heart for lifetimes melts a heart of stone brings tears to eyes needful of tears opens clouds to blue sky and to sunlight watches angels as they ascend and descend speaks of speaks the unknown formless eternal ever present –  the tumult dies down in the silence and the stillness only the pure sound of sound itself and  in that sound the absolution forgive them O Muse of Poetry they know not what they do yet in their hearts they know what must be said  The pain exquisite found worthy loved 
husband,Oft oft methinks the while with thee I breathe as from the heart thy dear And dedicated bame I hear A promise and a mystery A pledge of more than passing life Yea in that very name of wife  A pulse of love that neer can sleep A feeling that upbraids the heart With happiness beyond desert That gladness half requests to weep Nor bless I not the keener sense And unalarming turbulence  Of transient joys that ask no sting From jealous fears or coy denying But born beneath Loves brooding wing And into tenderness soon dying Wheel out their giddy moment then Resign the soul to love again  A more precipitated vein Of notes that eddy in the flow Of smoothest song they come they go And leave their sweeter understrain Its own sweet selfa love of thee That seems yet cannot greater be 
home,The railings were old and rusty The door paint was faded and chipped The poor old house had seen better days The roof made of slate had now dipped  The windows showed broken hinges The path to the door overgrown This was the place where I was born The only real home I had known  The rambler that clung to the front porch Was a rose in the deepest red Now looking forlorn and so straggly I thought that maybe it was dead  But tiny buds were shooting From the root beside the door And I was sure that with a little care The house would come alive once more  I watched as the SOLD sign was erected And I felt I had reached home at last I knew that I would be happy here After what had been in my past  I washed swept scrubbed and polished Until everything looked brand new Then my heart sped back to my childhood days My return home was well overdue  ©   Ernestine Northover 
beauty,I died for beauty but was scarce Adjusted in the tomb When one who died for truth was lain In an adjoining room  He questioned softly why I failed For beauty I replied And I for truth  the two are one We brethren are he said  And so as kinsmen met anight We talked between the rooms Until the moss had reached our lips And covered up our names 
winter,Above the marge of night a star still shines And on the frosty hills the sombre pines Harbor an eerie wind that crooneth low Over the glimmering wastes of virgin snow  Through the pale arch of orient the morn Comes in a milkwhite splendor newlyborn A sword of crimson cuts in twain the gray Banners of shadow hosts and lo the day 
romantic,This one is entering her teens Ripe for sentimental scenes Has picked a gangling unripe male Sees herself in bridal veil Presses lips and tosses head Declares shes not too young to wed Informs you pertly you forget Romeo and Juliet Do not argue do not shout Remind her how that one turned out 
heaven,Open thy gates To him who weeping waits And might come in But that held back by sin Let mercy be So kind to set me free And I will straight Come in or force the gate 
father,Most truly honoured and as truly dear If worth in me or ought I do appear Who can of right better demand the same Than may your worthy self from whom it came The principal might yield a greater sum Yet handled ill amounts but to this crumb My stocks so small I know not how to pay My bond remains in force unto this day Yet for part payment take this simple mite Where nothings to be had kings loose their right Such is my debt I may not say forgive But as I can Ill pay it while I live Such is my bond none can discharge but I Yet paying is not paid until I die 
moon,Now every leaf though colorless burns bright With disembodied and celestial light And drops without a movement or a sound A pillar of darkness to the shifting ground  The lucent thin and alcoholic flame Runs in the stubble with a nervous aim But when the eye pursues will point with fire Each single stubbletip and strain no higher  O triple goddess Contemplate my plight Opacity my fate Change my delight The yellow tomcat sunk in shifting fur Changes and dreams a phosphorescent blur  Sullen I wait but still the vision shun Bodiless thoughts and thoughtless bodies run 
mirror,Mirror upon mirror mirror after mirror mirror turning giddying after mirror turning giddying and a solitary human in the midst of the mirror circle aghast confused and wan directionless in all directions 
poem,How much better it seems now than when it is finally done– the unforgettable first line the cunning way the stanzas run  The rhymes softspoken and suggestive are barely audible at first an appetite not yet acknowledged like the inkling of a thirst  While gradually the form appears as each line is coaxed aloud– the architecture of a room seen from the middle of a crowd  The music that of common speech but slanted so that each detail sounds unexpected as a sharp inserted in a simple scale  No jumble box of imagery dumped glumly in the readers lap or elegantly packaged junk the unsuspecting must unwrap  But words that could direct a friend precisely to an unknown place those few unshakeable details that no confusion can erase  And the real subject left unspoken but unmistakable to those who dont expect a jungle parrot in the black and white of prose  How much better it seems now than when it is finally written How hungrily one waits to feel the bright lure seized the old hook bitten 
winter,The schoolboys still their morning ramble take To neighboring village school with playing speed Loitering with passtimes leisure till they quake Oft looking up the wildgeese droves to heed Watching the letters which their journeys make Or plucking haws on which their fieldfares feed And hips and sloes and on each shallow lake Making glib slides where they like shadows go Till some fresh passtimes in their minds awake Then off they start anew and hasty blow Their numbed and clumpsing fingers till they glow Then races with their shadows wildly run That stride huge giants oer the shining snow In the pale splendour of the winter sun 
river,The broad river flows fierce than an ocean In front of the longest bridge Both of us at the two ends and the sign board says Not allowed for pedestrians and only for heavy vehicles Our fruition is fruitless and how long we have to stand like this Forget the racism my sweetheart Who made us with the same clay We break this primitive fundamental bridge Jump to the river and swim upstream 
faith,In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes For they in thee a thousand errors note But tis my heart that loves what they despise Who in despite of view is pleased to dote Nor are mine cars with thy tongues tune delighted Nor tender feeling to base touches prone Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited To any sensual feast with thee alone But my five wits nor my five senses can Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be Only my plague thus far I count my gain That she that makes me sin awards me pain 
father,Life has many ways of telling our age Each more interesting with each new page But in my heart you will never grow old Dear Father of mine with many stories to be told  With patience and love you guided me Bringing me up the best I could be You worked hard and long even after I was grown Thank you dear Father for the love you have shown  So much to be learned from your experience All you went through all your endurance I will always treasure what you have done Dear Father of mine youre number one  So often this child has failed to say How much youre loved each passing day And I thank God He picked you to be The Greatest Father ever for me 
music,Id like to spend April sitting on a hill With a mushroom for a parasol and violets for a frill And the wind for a violin To play spring tunes And the blossoms in the treetops For gay balloons Id like to spend April sitting on a mound Watching for the flowers to pop out of the ground With their green silk stockings And new spring clothes Trying to look taller by dancing on their toes   1993 
river,There is a hill ahead And Death is behind the hill I urge the horses onward onward  There is a river here Always there is a river Just when Death scents victory  White current seethes About black rocks How fair the meadow is After crossing the water 
food,Old habits die hard We only live in present and dont look forward Live with junk food and rotten ideas All our advice fall on dear ears with no regard to pleas  We are prepared to live with all diseases No matter even if life comes to stand still or ceases We will follow new trend with hectic life and tension Please don’t advise us in matter with confusion  This is what new generation thinks Very shortly their life boat sinks So much tension and no way out This is life style and whole story about  Nothing is attained out of this habit There is no strength left in feet They crumble with little more weight Only wait for instant result without fight  Nobody is willing to wait for a second Even though some of the things may be beyond We try with half willingness and less determination It is not likely to grow any fruitful relation  Good food habits leads to culmination of good thoughts Many successes are had without external help being sought It calm downs the eagerness and stream into real strategy The less time will be spent even after remaining so much busy 
rain,A slight rain comes bathed in dawn light I hear it among treetop leaves before mist Arrives Soon it sprinkles the soil and Windblown follows clouds away Deepened  Colors grace thatch homes for a moment Flocks and herds of things wild glisten Faintly Then the scent of musk opens across Half a mountain  and lingers on past noon 
freedom,Freedom has turned into an illusion Just to be an illusion We have created a desease As we do as we please The population will decline Because theyve drunk the poison wine Comes too late to purify To what we come to testify A nation conditioned only to do wrong Now we dont know where we come from 
remember,She was an evil stepmother In her old age she is slowly dying in an empty hovel  She shudders like a clutch of burnt paper She does not remember that she was evil But she knows that she feels cold   Translated from the Polish by Czeslaw Milosz and Leonard Nathan  Anonymous Submission 
romantic,Shall I just stand and let the eyes drink The wine in the petals is shocking pink Inhale your aroma and watch your dance Join naughty winds in a rainy romance Shall I touch you with the lovers lips But I know for me arent nectar sips As you are smiling for the butterflies The colorful Angels from the skies Who is hidden in you could you speak You are soft but dense youll never leak But the eyes of a lover with a lovely peep See Him smiling in your soul so deep 
home,1     The sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home 2     Tis summer the darkies are gay 3     The corn tops ripe and the meadows in the bloom 4     While the birds make music all the day 5     The young folks roll on the little cabin floor 6     All merry all happy and bright 7     Byn by Hard Times comes a knocking at the door 8     Then my old Kentucky Home good night  9     Chorus Weep no more my lady oh weep no more today 10   We will sing one song 11   For the old Kentucky Home 12   For the old Kentucky Home far away  13   Solo They hunt no more for the possum and the coon 14   On the meadow the hill and the shore 15   They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon 16   On the bench by the old cabin door 17   The day goes by like a shadow oer the heart 18   With sorrow where all was delight 19   The time has come when the darkies have to part 20   Then my old Kentucky Home goodnight  21   Chorus Weep no more my lady oh weep no more today 22   We will sing one song 23   For the old Kentucky Home 24   For the old Kentucky Home far away  25   Solo The head must bow and the back will have to bend 26   Wherever the darkey may go 27   A few more days and the trouble all will end 28   In the field where the sugarcanes grow 29   A few more days for to tote the weary load 30   No matter twill never be light 31   A few more days till we totter on the road 32   Then my old Kentucky Home goodnight  33   Chorus Weep no more my lady oh weep no more today 34   We will sing one song 35   For the old Kentucky Home 36   For the old Kentucky Home far away 
moon,A bright moon rising above Tian Shan Mountain Lost in a vast ocean of clouds The long wind across thousands upon thousands of miles Blows past the Jadegate Pass The army of Han has gone down the Baiteng Road As the barbarian hordes probe at Qinghai Bay It is known that from the battlefield Few ever live to return Men at Garrison look on the border scene Home thoughts deepen sorrow on their faces In the towered chambers tonight Ceaseless are the womens sighs 
dance,At first I thought she waltzed but then I saw the error of my observation powers She waddled all that blubber garnished with shoulder pads covert suspenders and duct tape size called infinity a wave of air preceded the mass mostly the temperature was high but in the noise of raucous laughter it was hard to tell what happened  Yes men were at her feet all over the dancing hall though hardwood on a polished floor is without comfort No one was able to keep standing it was too much to grin and bear  Majestic gestures emanated clearly there was confusion as to the identity and origin was this thing human then And in the end it was decided that it had been good to have this episode though fleeting pay its short visit although the most intriguing part about the thing consisted of its skills to speak of things that human beings hold dear some raunchy stuff included And all were shocked though pretty glad when hardwood planks did give and cracked and Blubber sank to vanish through the hole from where some devils must have grabbed to commandeer the energy all the triglycerides not food for thought but something quite substantial 
dance,Ill dance all night Ill dance the pain away Ill dance until the morning sun Graces us with day  Ill dance until Im numb Until I dont feel anymore Ill dance until Im gone And dont remember what Im dancing for  Ill dance until you love me Ill dance the rest of my life Ill dance until you return By the moons gentle light  Ill dance to the music Of my shattering heart Ill dance until it doesnt hurt As you tear me apart 
animal,No earthquake no thunder no volcanic eruption Or even there was not any of other natural calamities A sudden loud sound broke out all through the bush With whizzing shuddering cracking tearing echoing Fear horror dark terror misery and ill spirits spread Committing destruction death in a horrible situation Dust dirt smoke coiled over the whole atmosphere The harmless animals are quite perplexed helpless They began crying shouting running rushing fainting Seeing reddish spots and innumerable torn bodies  They blamed one another for committing the crime Brawling harming plotting hardened in them A long conflict complicated and awful tangled Loosing the worms of crime injustice and corruption The virtues sunk and the vices rose everywhere Envious state of barbarism terrorism inflicted on them The poor animals lost peace and principles they had Centuries curses engulfed all what was out of thought  Ferocious animals are in the neighboring big forest Who always wait for chances on the helpless ones They do not care for hesitating in violating terms Committing all sorts of hyenas and monstrous harms They know how and when to cook poisonous broth And how to throw an unseen net to catch the rest  Once some cats were quarrelling nearby the bush Some wild dogs of the big forest made an instant rush For repeated barking mewing was beyond of hearing Foxes and monkeys also joined within a quick haste Crows kites and vultures started crowing for the feast What more rats and mice left the bush being frightened Dreadful tumult commotion collision conflict took place At the arrival of buffalos deer bears wolfs and hyenas  But with sudden and unexpected appearance of Jaguars lions tigers and some bears rejoining to them Returning from the herd of small and weak beasts Consisting boars wolfs hyenas wild pigs and dogs Though wolfs and hyenas started loudly barking But came to no use and got chased retreated soon All the surroundings became instant silent and isolated All went away murmuring without more looking back  The victorious were excited having got all easy victory But they found troubles to enjoy the whole empire lonely So there were roaring shouting blustering threatening Of occupying empire power lordship and over lordship Finally all the bestial rules with ‘Might is right were Established in rules and regulations less animal state  Copyright © Muzahidul Reza  6 October 2016 
despair,I want to see what is hidden In the deep layers Of my life I wish to look On the other side Of a big glass door Thats blocking my view I desire if I can See smell and hear That sweet voice of hope and faith That I have lost I hope one day The door of illussion Will open successfully On its own So I can relax And not feel stressed from this constant race Of this life Where only struggle Greets my morns And pushes me to The edge of despair 
truth,Gone I say and walk from church refusing the stiff procession to the grave letting the dead ride alone in the hearse It is June  I am tired of being brave  We drive to the Cape  I cultivate myself where the sun gutters from the sky where the sea swings in like an iron gate and we touch  In another country people die  My darling the wind falls in like stones from the whitehearted water and when we touch we enter touch entirely  No ones alone Men kill for this or for as much  And what of the dead  They lie without shoes in the stone boats  They are more like stone than the sea would be if it stopped  They refuse to be blessed throat eye and knucklebone

laughter,The other day I had had The smell of spellbound emitted from her love That made me sorrowful and as a dead man later on But the blooming flowers were laughing and told at last You  are in a state of being intoxicatedtry to get out of obsession  My question was to them Do you know that scientist Einstein were fall in love too  They again laugh and laugh Meaningless laughter  I was inflamed and so shouted stop your laughter You are  emitting illusions too I know 
green,goodness reasons to revel by reality heart yet knows right path to heaven eyes raves back by illusion of mirage light refluxes into room of delusion  do we ever know depth of eyes by mystery as sands gleaned on shore delving blue myth of blindness yet they still read moment swirls by winds unfolding dreams  moon seems to be here on top of hill whispers allays sorrow by voices where is the time lost to living life when reasoned to grip of wine as desire mills through green of wild 
sun,Sometimes a mortal feels in himself Nature  not his Father but his Mother stirs within him and he becomes immortal with her immortality From time to time she claims kindredship with us and some globule from her veins steals up into our own  I am the autumnal sun With autumn gales my race is run When will the hazel put forth its flowers Or the grape ripen under my bowers When will the harvest or the hunters moon Turn my midnight into midnoon I am all sere and yellow And to my core mellow The mast is dropping within my woods The winter is lurking within my moods And the rustling of the withered leaf Is the constant music of my grief 
life,I keep the Cross before my eyes And know the sacrifice He made His life for mine His life for ALL Is what his dieing  did that day  I hear the shouts and feel the pain As He trudged His destined way Scourged deserted denied betrayed SoonHis death became   The heavons exploaded the lightened raged His followers bewildered lay All hope was lost Nothing remained   Then came the Glorious Easter Day

friend,You smile upon your friend today Today his ills are over You hearken to the lovers say And happy is the lover  Tis late to hearken late to smile But better late than never I shall have lived a little while Before I die for ever 
son,One Word of Thine can heal my wounded heart One look divine can work wonders from start One Word of Thine can change water to wine One touch of Thine can make a Leper fine  Authority in Thine words what we find Divinity none can be than Thy mind Psychology of man Thou knowst so well Who can with the Son of God argue tell  What anger great Thou hast shown in some place Thine advice can soothe any angry face Thine parables drive home morals so great Sins the thing not the sinner Thou did hate What love Thou had shown to the poor brethren And kindness too to the atheist heathen 
husband,Eating wearing flowers delight in heart and beautifying are all only for him to see  O my friend  While knowing that in spite of my husband had left me for earning sake  you had come to beautify me Is it not your ignorance  him  husband accompanying maid or friend helps in beautifying the girl 
kiss,Away from the night Everyone moves across the street To be together far from They are attracted to the light And the music the flesh makes As it dies Traveling away from home A cross to where I have no eyes intersecting without hope And I can not see where she is gone The thing that never was between us And the flowers in the gutter leading To the sea before the sun rises The thing that never was dissolves and goes away In tiny fragments before the sun And her kiss imagined always felt But never All the pleasures of the system petals budding From the glowing stems Like lines on a road The conduits of rushing people Discarding me And I am roadkill lying dead beside Her bed as they make some kind of attempt at love And forgotten on her neck a broken gem Once priceless now trash In the shadows beside where all The lives move Dances to the lights and forgets Neighborhoods drunken and empty abandoned museums And the life flipping over in mausoleums Pages in a book read but Not understood a bed of transgressions And falsehoods madeup to hide the stains Like the nights coming on attracting the Insects calling our humanity a god of weekends And spirits past Forgetting to resist the temptation Where my wrist lays open and waiting  For a kiss 
winter,1     For weeks and weeks the autumn world stood still 2         Clothed in the shadow of a smoky haze 3     The fields were dead the wind had lost its will 4     And all the lands were hushed by wood and hill 5         In those grey withered days  6     Behind a mist the blear sun rose and set 7         At night the moon would nestle in a cloud 8     The fisherman a ghost did cast his net 9     The lake its shores forgot to chafe and fret 10       And hushed its caverns loud  11   Far in the smoky woods the birds were mute 12       Save that from blackened tree a jay would scream 13   Or far in swamps the lizards lonesome lute 14   Would pipe in thirst or by some gnarlèd root 15       The treetoad trilled his dream  16   From day to day still hushed the seasons mood 17       The streams stayed in their runnels shrunk and dry 18   Suns rose aghast by wave and shore and wood 19   And all the world with ominous silence stood 20       In weird expectancy  21   When one strange night the sun like blood went down 22       Flooding the heavens in a ruddy hue 23   Red grew the lake the sere fields parched and brown 24   Red grew the marshes where the creeks stole down 25       But never a windbreath blew  26   That night I felt the winter in my veins 27       A joyous tremor of the icy glow 28   And woke to hear the norths wild vibrant strains 29   While far and wide by withered woods and plains 30       Fast fell the driving snow
