How to run this project?
1. Upload the whole baseline folder to coli sever.
2. Install the requirements.txt.
3. Unzip the CCPC.zip
4. run the run.sh

You will get:
1. A best model with the lowest validation loss
2. A log file with loss information
3. A checkpoint file
4. Plots in your wandb account

Current observations:
The best validation loss(about 5.0) is still too high to use. 

Note: 
The test file is not completed. Mengli is still woking on evaluation using some metrics like accuracy or BLEU, 
so no more test scores can be reported at this moment.

Welcome to add more features/better model design/suggestions on fine-tuning.
Contact me if anything.
